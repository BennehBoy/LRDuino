Version 0.97
OBD Support added - at this stage it is using a modified version of -> https://github.com/irvined1982/arduino-ELM327  Main changes are to filter out all non alpha chars & the ELM prompt '>' to allow interfacing with obdsim running on a windows xp virtual machine in virtualbox via a bluetooth com port.
Large font OBD sensor drawing fucntion added for RPM, MPH

Version 0.96
Moved MAX31586 & SSD1306 devices to shared HW SPI bus. This incorporates several pin wiring changes.
Ditched Adafruit_31586 library in favour of custom code
Now uses 8 OLED displays
Prelimary bluetooth code included & OBD2 sensors using ELM 327 library.
OBD sensors added to sensor structure - this will expand to cover most common PID's
Pins are now initialised to correct state and input/ouput definition.
Added units 'rpm' & 'mph'
Various formatting changes for readability

Version 0.95
Added compass graphic
Added sensor pairing
Consolidated display drawing to 1 function, this means that each sensor occupies 1 screen with a graph unless it is 'paired'
Updated posrot and active sensor counting functions to account for pairing
functionised test drawing.

Version 0.94
Removed Arduino nano/uno support - they don't have enough ram/gpio (version 0.93 will be kept in a 'legacy' folder for anyone wanting to hack against uno/nano)
Added magnetometer support & a compass graphic HMC5883
Moved all the sensor config into an array of structs
Moved the audible warning code out of the display routine - this way alarms not on screen can be heard (at a higher beep rate)
Expanded to 20 sensors (will define the most standard OBD PIDs here)
Added pitch meter and associated animation gfx

Version 0.93
STM32 support added
Pins abdstracted to defines
Added 'DIVISOR' definition - STM32 ADC is 12 bit so returns values 0-4095 whereas Nano/Uno is 10 bit with values 0-1023.  Sensor reading fucntions updated to use this.

Version 0.92
Moved barchart drawing into a function, this can be called from any of the display drawing fuctions with a reference to the OLED object
Made it so that sensors can be enabled/disabled at compile time - new array senseactive[]  The posrot function now populates based on active sensors only.

Version 0.91
Changed font used for values & errors to FreeSansBoldOblique12pt7b - nice TTF font, code amended to reflect baseline change in this font from standard.
Tidied some repetetive fault checking code nto a helper function.
Changed some of the comments to hopefully make the code easier to follow.
Fixed a bug where warning faulted sensors were displaying warning values - not really necessary to do this.
Fixed a bug where display1 was drawing the sensor twice - meant that warnings/faults would not animate.

Version 0.90
Moved gfx to seperate .h file
Added animation to the roll icon
Added low warning values and code

Version 0.89
Overhauled the display code to look much prettier
Reduced some memory usage by breaking out some of the display code into functions

Version 0.88
Version history broken out into seperate file
Added Sensor data for the adxl345 to the array
Added a graphic for roll
Added a graphic for coolant level
Updated the rotation code so that all sensors now rotate around the displays (1 extra OLED would mean all 7 could be shown at once)
Updated the 'units' code so that boolean types (LOW, OK for coolant level)  degrees are now catered for * not happy with this yet, think it needs some sensor description in the array of sensors
Changed from square() function to sq() - compatability with STM32

Version 0.87
Switched to Fabo ADXL345 library, this saves 1766 bytes of Progmem, and 223 bytes of Dyn mem!

Version 0.86
Decoupled sensor input pins from array index - read functions now need to also be passed the array index to store data
Moved some pins around to accomodate i2c on a4,a5
Added initial support for ADXL345 Accelerometer

Version 0.85
Fault signals now reset max recorded values to the minimum of the scalerange
Fixed bug with screen rotation - it's not a good idea values outside of the bounds of and array! "if (faultWARN(6)==1)"
Fixed bug analogue inputs need to correspond to their analogue pin, this is because the code implicitly expects them on those...

Version 0.84
Added low coolant warning, &assoicated variables & functions - shows on display1 only
fixed bug in doWarnings() where we were directly referencing display 1 & 3 rather than passing in a reference to the display that we wanted to draw on
reverted scalerange change to int back to float - graph was drawing only at left

Version 0.83
Initial upload to github
