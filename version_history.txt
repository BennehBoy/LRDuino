Version 0.90
Moved gfx to seperate .h file
Added animation to the roll icon
Added low warning values and code

Version 0.89
Overhauled the display code to look much prettier
Reduced some memory usage by breaking out some of the display code into functions

Version 0.88
Version history broken out into seperate file
Added Sensor data for the adxl345 to the array
Added a graphic for roll
Added a graphic for coolant level
Updated the rotation code so that all sensors now rotate around the displays (1 extra OLED would mean all 7 could be shown at once)
Updated the 'units' code so that boolean types (LOW, OK for coolant level)  degrees are now catered for * not happy with this yet, think it needs some sensor description in the array of sensors
Changed from square() function to sq() - compatability with STM32

Version 0.87
Switched to Fabo ADXL345 library, this saves 1766 bytes of Progmem, and 223 bytes of Dyn mem!

Version 0.86
Decoupled sensor input pins from array index - read functions now need to also be passed the array index to store data
Moved some pins around to accomodate i2c on a4,a5
Added initial support for ADXL345 Accelerometer

Version 0.85
Fault signals now reset max recorded values to the minimum of the scalerange
Fixed bug with screen rotation - it's not a good idea values outside of the bounds of and array! "if (faultWARN(6)==1)"
Fixed bug analogue inputs need to correspond to their analogue pin, this is because the code implicitly expects them on those...

Version 0.84
Added low coolant warning, &assoicated variables & functions - shows on display1 only
fixed bug in doWarnings() where we were directly referencing display 1 & 3 rather than passing in a reference to the display that we wanted to draw on
reverted scalerange change to int back to float - graph was drawing only at left

Version 0.83
Initial upload to github
